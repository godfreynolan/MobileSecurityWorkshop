# Mobile Security Workshop

* **Lab 1: Decompile 101**
	>*In this lab , we find and download an app from a rooted or jailbroken phone. We also download the saved data. We then decompile/disassemble the code and view the user's data.*
  
* **Lab 2: Weak Server Side Controls**
	>*In this lab , using OWASP's Herd Financial app we show how a hacker can view and manipulate user account data. We show how to use tools to scan your server to improve its security.*  

* **Lab 3: Insecure Data Storage**
	>*In this lab , using OWASP's Goat Droid app we show how a hacker can find a user's information in shared preferences and SQLite databases.*  
  
* **Lab 4: Insufficient Transport Layer Protection**
	>*In this lab , we use a proxy server to view unencrypted http and https traffic.*  
  
* **Lab 5: Unintended Data Leakage**
	>*In this lab , we see what 3rd party libraries are sending back to base.*  
  
* **Lab 6: Poor Authorization and Authentication**
	>*In this lab , we see how user's credentials are often stored inappropriately allowing hackers to gain access to someone's account.*    
  
* **Lab 7: Broken Cryptography**
	>*In this lab , we see how insecure cryptography can expose your user's information. We look at how to decrypt and also how to properly encrypt data so it can't be compromized.*
  
* **Lab 8: Client Side Injection**
	>*In this lab , we see how a hacker can use SQL injection and XSS to bypass an app's security and how to prevent it.*    
  
* **Lab 9: Security Decision via Untrusted Input**
	>*In this lab , we see how implicit intents can allow hackers to pry open your app and how to secure it using explicit intents.*    
  
* **Lab 10: Improper Session Handling**
	>*In this lab , we see how never expiring tokens can allow a hacker to backup these tokens from one phone to another.* 

* **Lab 11: Lack of Binary Protections**
	>*In this lab , we obfuscate an app and see how successful it is at protecting your code.*  
  
* **Lab 12: Debugging an app**
	>*In this lab , we make an app debuggable, reinstall it and then step through the app within the IDE.*
  
* **Lab 13: SafetyNet API**
	>*In this lab , we add the SafetyNet API to our app and detect when it's running on a rooted phone.*
  
* **Lab 14: Frida**
	>*In this lab , we add use the JavaScript injection tool, Frida, to hack an app.*
